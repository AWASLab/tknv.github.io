<blockquote>Now many country is going down. Alas I think soon more bad after 2,3 years. This is the end of capitalism. And the time to know ourself what is enough. All adults should know enough and share them. Someone said who wants make it free. Yes I agree it. But someone can not get it by their salary. Because they did not get fair salary to buy it. Someone took too much before reach them. This is reason what happen now in globe.</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer">/TKNV</div>
